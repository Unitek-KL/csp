/* Function:
    void SSCx_Initialize (void);
    
  Summary:
    Initializes SSCx module of the device
    
  Description:
    This function initializes SSCx module of the device with the values
    configured in MHC GUI. Once the peripheral is initialized, transfer
    APIs can be used to transfer the data.
  
  Precondition:
    MHC GUI should be configured with the right values.
  
  Parameters:
    None.
  
  Returns:
    None.
    
  Example:
    <code>
        SSC0_Initialize();
    </code>
    
  Remarks:
    This function must be called only once and before any other SSC function is
    called.
