  Summary
    UART peripheral library interface.

  Description
    This file defines the interface to the UART peripheral library.  This 
    library provides access to and control of the associated peripheral 
    instance.

  Remarks:
    This header is for documentation only.  The actual plib_uart<x> headers 
    will be generated as required by the MCC (where <x> is the peripheral 
    instance number).

    Every interface symbol has a lower-case 'x' in it following the "UART" 
    abbreviation.  This 'x' will be replaced by the peripheral instance number
    in the generated headers.  These are the actual functions that should be
    used.

/* Callback Function Pointer

   Summary:
    Defines the data type and function signature for the UART peripheral

   Description:
    This data type defines the function signature for the UART peripheral 
    callback function. The UART peripheral will call back the client's 
    function with this signature when the UART buffer event has occurred.

   Precondition:
    UARTx_Initialize must have been called for the given UART peripheral 
    instance and UARTx_CallbackRegister must have been called to set the 
    function to be called.

   Parameters:
    status  - Complete or error status of the UART buffer transfer.
    
    direction  - Direction of transfer associated with the event.
    
    context  - Allows the caller to provide a context value (usually a pointer
    to the callers context for multi-instance clients).
  
   Returns:
    None.

   Example:
    <code>
    // Data tracking what each of my instances is doing.
    MY_DATA myData[2];

    void MyUartCallback ( UART_TRANSFER_STATUS status, 
        UART_DIRECTION direction, uintptr_t context )

   Summary:
    Submits a write buffer to the given UART peripheral to transfer.

   Description:
    This function submits a write buffer to the UART peripheral to transfer.
    The behavior of this function call will vary based on the mode 
    selected within MCC.
    
    If the peripheral is configured for the interrupt mode, this function call 
    is always non-blocking. Call to this function submits the buffer and the 
    size to the peripheral library and returns immediately. User can check the 
    transfer status either through callback mechanism or by calling 
    UARTx_TransferStatusGet.
    
    If the peripheral is configured for the non-interrupt mode, this 
    function call returns only after requested size is transferred.    

   Precondition:

   Parameters:
    buffer - Pointer to the user buffer.
    size - Number of bytes to be transferred.
  
   Returns:
    Number of bytes processed.
    Returns -1 if the arguments are not valid or if the library is in an error 
	state.

   Summary:
    Submits a read buffer to the given UART peripheral to process.

   Description:
    This function submits a read buffer to the UART peripheral to process.
    The behavior of this function call will vary based on the mode 
    selected within MCC.
    
    If the peripheral is configured for the interrupt mode, this function call 
    is always non-blocking. Call to this function submits the buffer and the 
    size to the peripheral library and returns immediately. User can check the 
    transfer status either through callback mechanism or by calling

/* Function:

    given UART's transfer events occur.

   Description:
    This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" 
    when the given UART's transfer events occur. It also passes a context value 
    (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the

    operation.

   Precondition:

   Description:
    This function clears the errors associated with the given UART peripheral 
    instance.

/* Function:
    bool UARTx_ReadyStatusGet( UART_DIRECTION direction )

   Summary:
    Returns the hardware status of Transmit or Receive associated with the given 
	UART peripheral instance.

   Description:
    This function returns the hardware status associated with 
    the Transmit or Receive hardware FIFO of the given UART peripheral 
	instance.
	
	When Transmit is ready, user can submit data for the transmit. 
	When Receive is ready, user can read the received data.
	
	This function is available only in non-interrupt mode of operation. And can
	be used to achieve non-blocking behavior of write and read requests. User 
	has to check the Transmit or Receive ready status by calling this function 
	and can submit write or read request for the buffer size of 1.  

   Precondition:
    UARTx_Initialize must have been called for the associated UART instance.

   Parameters:
    direction - Direction of transfer of which the ready status is requested.
  
   Returns:
    true - Transmit hardware FIFO has empty space to accept the data for the 
	transfer or Receive hardware FIFO has data available to be read.
	false - Transmit hardware FIFO is full or Receive hardware FIFO is empty.

  Example:
    <code>
    if(true == UART1_ReadyStatusGet(UART_RECEIVE))
    {
		// Data is available and can read a byte
        UART1_Read(&rxData, 1);
    }
	else
	{
		//Data is not available to read
	}
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If user submits read or write request for more than 1 byte after checking 
	the ready status, then read or write API will block until the submitted 
	length of data is processed. This is the native behavior of read and write 
	API in the non-interrupt mode of library.
