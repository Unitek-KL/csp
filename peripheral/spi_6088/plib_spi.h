  Summary:
    Setup SPI operational parameters as desired by the client.

  Description:
    This function setup SPI x with the values needed by the client dynamically.
    Values passed through setup structure will be the new setup for SPI
    transmission. Even if user is not intending to modify all the setup
    parameters, he must update his setup structure with all its parameters. If
    user do not update all the setup structure elements, then unexpected SPI
    behavior may occur.

    User need not call this function if he has configured the setup in GUI and
    there is no dynamic change needed in any of the parameters.

  Precondition:
    SPI x must first be initialized using SPIx_Initialize().

  Parameters :
    spiSourceClock - Source Clock frequency in Hz on which SPI module is running.

    *setup - pointer to the data structure of type SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP which has the
             list of elements to be setup for a client.

  Returns:
    true  - if setup was successful, API returns true.
    false - if spiSourceClock and spi clock frequencies are such that resultant
            SCBR value is out of the possible range, then API returns false.

  Example:
    <code>
        SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP setup;
        setup.clockFrequency = 1000000;
        setup.clockPhase = SPI_CLOCK_PHASE_TRAILING_EDGE;

		void* pReceiveData,

	);

  Summary:
    Write and Read data on SPI x peripheral

  Description:
    This function should be used to write "txSize" number of bytes and read
    "rxSize" number of bytes on SPI x module. Data pointed by pTransmitData
    is transmitted and received data is saved in the location pointed by
    pReceiveData.

    The function will work differently as per the configuration done in
    MCC as described below:

    1.  Blocking Configuration (Non-Interrupt mode): When "Interrupt Mode"
        option is unchecked in GUI, the generated code for that particular
        SPI PLIB instance will be blocking. In this particular mode, the
        WriteRead API will not return until all the requested data is transferred.

        After transferring all the data, boolean status 'True' is returned
        indicating operation completion.

    2.  Non-Blocking Configuration (Interrupt mode): When "Interrupt Mode"
        option is selected in GUI, the generated code for that
        particular SPI PLIB instance will be Non-blocking in nature. In this
        particular mode, application will give the data transfer
        responsibility to the PLIB and come back and start doing other
        activities, SPI Data transaction will happen in the corresponding ISR.
        in this mode, the transmit and receive data locations provided by user
        must remain valid until the data transfer is complete.
        Application can check the data transfer completion status via
        callback or polling mechanism. In case of callback, it needs to be
        registered prior to calling the WriteRead API. Data transfer status
        polling can be done using "SPIx_IsBusy" API.

  Precondition:
    The SPIx_Initialize function must have been called.

    Callback has to be registered using SPIx_CallbackRegister API if the
    peripheral instance has been configured in Interrupt mode and
    transfer completion status needs to be communicated back to application via
    callback.

  Parameters:
    *pTransmitData  Pointer to the data which has to be transmitted. if it is
                    NULL, that means only data receiving is expected. For 9
                    to 15bit mode, data should be right aligned in the 16 bit
                    memory location.
    txSize          Number of bytes to be transmitted. Always, size should be
                    given in terms of bytes. For example, if 5 16-bit data
                    are to be transmitted, the transmit size should be 10 bytes.
    *pReceiveData   Pointer to the location where received data has to be stored.
                    It is user's responsibility to ensure pointed location has
                    sufficient memory to store the read data.
                    if it is NULL, that means only data transmission is expected.
                    For 9 to 15bit mode, received data will be right aligned in
                    the 16 bit memory location.
    rxSize          Number of bytes to be received. Always, size should be
                    given in terms of bytes. For example, if 5 16-bit data
                    are to be received, the receive size should be 10 bytes.
                    if "n" number of bytes has to be received AFTER transmitting
                    "m" number of bytes, then "rxSize" should be set as "m+n".

  Returns:
    In Blocking mode, API returns True once the transfer is complete. It returns
    False if either of the size parameters are 0 and corresponding data pointer
    is NULL.

    In interrupt mode, if previous buffer request is not completed and a new
    transfer request comes, then this API will reject the new request and will
    return "False". Also, Same as blocking mode, It returns False if either of
    the size parameters are 0 and corresponding data pointer is NULL.

  Example:
    <code>
    uint8_t     txBuffer[4];
    uint8_t     rxBuffer[10];
    size_t      txSize = 4;
    size_t      rxSize = 10;
    bool        reqAccepted;

    SPI1_Initialize();

    SPI1_CallbackRegister(&APP_SPITransferHandler, NULL);

    reqAccepted = SPI1_WriteRead(&txBuffer, txSize, &rxBuffer, rxSize);

    void APP_SPITransferHandler(uintptr_t context)
    {

        //Transfer was completed without error, do something else now.

    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Non-blocking interrupt mode configuration implementation of this function
    will be used by Harmony driver implementation APIs.
