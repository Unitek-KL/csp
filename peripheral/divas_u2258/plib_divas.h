  Divide Square Root Accelerator (DIVAS) PLIB

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    plib_divas.h

  Summary:
    DIVAS Peripheral Library Interface Header File.

  Description:
    This file defines the interface to the DIVAS peripheral library. This
    library provides access to and control of the associated peripheral
    instance.

  Remarks:
    This header is for documentation only.  The actual plib_divas<x> headers
    will be generated as required by the MCC (where <x> is the peripheral
    instance number).

    Every interface symbol has a lower-case 'x' in it following the "DIVAS"
    abbreviation.  This 'x' will be replaced by the peripheral instance number
    in the generated headers.  These are the actual functions that should be
    used.

/* Function:
    void DIVASx_Initialize(void);

  Summary:
    Initializes DIVAS x module of the device.

  Description:
    This function initializes DIVAS x module of the device with the values
    configured in MCC GUI. Once the peripheral is initialized, signed, unsigned
    divsion and square root functions can be used.

  Precondition:
    MCC GUI should be configured with the right values.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
        DIVASx_Initialize();
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This function must be called before any other DIVAS function is called.
    This function should only be called once during system initialization.

/* Function:
    bool DIVASx_DivideSigned ( int32_t divisor, int32_t dividend,
                                int32_t * quotient, int32_t * remainder );

  Summary:
    This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to performs a signed 32-bit
    division.

  Description:
    This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to perform a signed 32-bit division.
    The function takes a signed divisor and dividend and returns the quotient
    and remainder. If the library is configured (in MHC) with the Leading Zero
    optimization option enabled, a division operation takes 2-16 cycles. If the
    option is disabled, the option always takes 16 cycles. The latter option is
    recommended if deterministic operation is desired.

  Precondition:
    The peripheral should have been initialized by calling the
    DIVASx_Initialize() function once. The AHB clock to the DIVAS Peripheral
    should have been enabled.

  Parameters:
    divisor - This should contain the signed divisor.

    dividend - This should contain the signed dividend.

    quotient - This is a pointer to a output paramter which will contain the
    quotient of the division operation. This value is valid if the division
    operation was successful. This can be NULL if the quotient is note required.

    remainder - This is a pointer to a output paramter which will contain the
    remainder of the division operation. This value is valid if the division
    operation was successful. This can be NULL if the remained is not required.

  Returns:
    true - if the division operation was successful.
    false - if a divide-by-zero error has occurred.

  Example:
    <code>
        int32_t divisor;
        int32_t dividend;
        int32_t quotient;
        int32_t remainder;

        divisor = -2000;
        dividend = 10000;

        if (true == DIVASx_DivideSigned(divisor, dividend, &quotient, &remainder ))
        {
            // quotient and remainder will have valid values.
        }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    None.

  Summary:
    This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to performs a unsigned 32-bit

  Description:
    This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to perform unsigned 32-bit division.

    DIVASx_Initialize() function once. The AHB clock to the DIVAS peripheral
    should have been enabled.

  Parameters:
    divisor - This should contain the unsigned divisor.

    dividend - This should contain the unsigned dividend.

    quotient - This is a pointer to a output paramter which will contain the
    quotient of the division operation. This value is valid if the division
    operation was successful. This can be NULL if the quotient is not required.

    remainder - This is a pointer to a output paramter which will contain the
    remainder of the division operation. This value is valid if the division
    operation was successful. This can be NULL if the remainder is not required.

  Returns:
    true - if the division operation was successful.
    false - if a divide-by-zero error has occurred.

/* Function:
    uint32_t DIVASx_SquareRoot ( uint32_t number , uint32_t * remainder);

  Summary:
    This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to perform a square root operation.

  Description:
    This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to perform a square root operation.
    The function will return the square root of the number contained in number.
    The remainder output parameter will contain a remainder if the square root
    was not perfect.

  Precondition:
    The peripheral should have been initialized by calling the
    DIVASx_Initialize() function once. The AHB clock to the DIVAS peripheral
    should have been enabled.

  Parameters:
    number - unsigned number whose square root needs to be obtained.

    remainder - pointer to an output parameter which will contain the remainder
    of the square root operation (in case of a imperfect square root operation).
    This can be NULL if the remainder is not required.

  Returns:
    The function returns the square root of the value contained in the number
    parameter.

  Example:
    <code>
        uint32_t number;
        uint32_t remainder;
        uint32_t squareRoot;

        number = 144;
